This file contains OFSwitch13 release notes (most recent releases first).

Release XXXXX (August XX, 2016)
==============================

- Including support for multiple controllers on the same OpenFlow network
  domain.

- Removing the need of registering the switch at the controller before the
  connection start.

- Removing from the OpenFlow device the controller address attribute. It now
  must be indicated by the helper as a parameter to StartControllerConnection.

- Create the SocketReader class to read OpenFlow messages from TCP sockets in
  safe and independently way.

- Creating the RemoteController and RemoteSwitch classes, which can be used to
  independently store information of several remote connections, allowing the
  implementation of multiple controller functionality.

- Refactoring the OFSwitch13Controller class:
  * Splitting the DpctlCommand into execute and schedule versions;
  * Removing dependence from OFSwitch13Device class;
  * Renaming ConnectionStarted to HandshakeSuccessful to reflect semantic;
  * Implementing the handshake procedure;
  * Implementing barrier reply, hello and features reply handlers;
  * Using constant pointers to RemoteSwitch objects to avoid mistakes.

- Refactoring the OFSwitch13Helper class to support the configuration of
  OpenFlow networks domains with multiple controllers:
  * Removing the dependence of installing the controller before the switches;
  * The new CreateOpenFlowChannels () member function was introduced to
    effectively connect switches to controllers after installing switches
    devices and controller applications into respective nodes (the use of this
    function is mandatory).


Release 2.0.2 (April 11, 2016)
==============================

- Including the QosController example.

- The OpenFlow device is not an NetDevice child anymore. This was done to avoid
  misleading interpretation and configuration problems with further ns-3
  versions. The OFSwitch13NetDevice class was renamed to OFSwitch13Device to
  better reflect this change.

- Replacing the CsmaNetDevice OpenFlow trace source, used by prior versions to
  get packets from the CsmaNetDevice port, by a new CsmaNetDevice OpenFlow
  receive callback. This new callback avoid problems with internal receive
  semantics in the way that, for CsmaNetDevice configure as OpenFlow ports, the
  default receive callback is never invoked.

- Creating a OFSwitch13DeviceContainer for handling CsmaNetDevices. Note the
  change on InstallSwitch* methods on the OFSwitch13Helper.

- By default, 8 priority queues are created for each OFSwitch13Queue and are
  available for use.

- Updating the documentation with a better module design description (including
  new figures) and the QosController description. Minor corrections along the
  entire text.

- This code is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library, release v2.0.x and ns-3
  versions 3.22, 3.23 and 3.24.1, and 3.25 (including patches for ns-3.25).


Release 2.0.1 (February 16, 2016)
=================================

- Updating the documentation with more details on the differences between this
  module and the existing ns-3 one.

- Including patches for already tested ns-3 versions (3.22, 3.23 and 3.24.1).

- Including this release notes file.

- This code is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library, release v2.0.x and ns-3
  versions 3.22, 3.23 and 3.24.1.


Release 2.0.0 (February 15, 2016)
=================================

- First public release of the OFSwitch13 module, including source code and
  documentation.

- This code is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library, release v2.0.x and ns-3
  versions 3.22, 3.23 and 3.24.1.
